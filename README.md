## PBSmapping: Mapping fisheries data and spatial analysis tools ##
&copy; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2003-2018)

This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Embedded C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as finding polygons that contain specified point events or converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Additionally, we include C++ code developed by Angus Johnson for the Clipper library, data for a global shoreline, and other data sets in the public domain.

This site assists developers in tracking and resolving bugs and other issues. Users of PBSmapping should obtain the current release from standard R repositories, such as <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PBSmapping">CRAN</a>.

**PBSmapping** represents just one of a series of R packages developed at the Pacific Biological Station (<a href="http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/index-eng.html#pbs">PBS</a>) in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A more advanced version of **PBSmapping** might be available at <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software">pbs-software on GitHub</a>. Any evolving package (Windows binary and source tarball) is built after using CRAN's rigorous `R CMD check --as-cran` routine (on a Windows system) and posted to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2Bkic2Qu5LGOGx1WkRySVYxNFU?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>. Most of the time, the revision on <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-mapping">GitHub</a> can be built (supposedly) in R using `devtools::install_github("pbs-software/pbs-mapping")`; however, not every revision has been checked for CRAN worthiness.
