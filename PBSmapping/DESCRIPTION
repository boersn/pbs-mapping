Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research
        conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo,
        British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include
        two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
        available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded
        C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
        finding polygons that contain specified point events or
        converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
        Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  It includes data for a global
        shoreline and other data sets in the public domain. The R directory 
        '.../library/PBSmapping/doc' includes a complete user's guide 
        PBSmapping-UG.pdf. To use this package effectively, please 
        consult the guide.
